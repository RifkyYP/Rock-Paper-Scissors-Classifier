# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Classifier
Submission fulfillment of Machine Learning Project by Dicoding Academy

This project shows you how to solve the computer vision problem. You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout. This project also introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.
